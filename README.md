# first_ml_deployment
30/06/2023
i had built a very standard and unimaginative ml model that uses an NB classifier, the model takes in text input of the patient's symptoms and predicts the disease that the patient has with approx 96% accuracy
the model is trained to predict only 24 diseases, as time progresses, i plan on building every model used in this project from scratch and also increase the traingin dataset to include every possible disease
this will obviously reduce the accuracy as multiple diseases have the same symptoms, but it is only to test my nlp skills
